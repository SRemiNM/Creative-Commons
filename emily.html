              “Have you heard about Medusa?” seems to be the question of the day. No conversation in the many hallways of school could be heard without the mention of Medusa’s name. As soon as I enter the building, with only one foot through the door, my friend rushes towards me and asks, “Did you hear what happened to Medusa? Oh, I feel so bad for her”.
              <br>
              I did not have any time to check my phone last night because I was cramming for my biology test. But apparently something very bad must have happened to Medusa, seeing how distressed my friend looks, so I quickly reply, “No, what happened to her?”
                <br>
              My friend takes a deep breath and responds, “Well, supposedly last night Medusa hooked up with Poseidon, but a lot of people are saying that Poseidon actually raped her. I don’t know what really happened, but the rape story sounds more convincing to me because you know how gorgeous Medusa is and how literally every guy wants her, but she didn’t like any of them. Anyways, Athena got really mad at Medusa for some reason and was somehow able to leak Medusa’s nudes. She is trying destroy her life. Medusa’s reputation is already completely ruined by now. People are calling her a slut and commenting it on all her posts. I don’t know how Medusa is going to be able to find a job in the future because those pictures show up when you search her name. But it gets even worse. I also heard that Athena shaved Medusa’s head and then put some weird product on it so that her hair can never grow back again. She doesn’t want anyone to ever like her again.”
              <br>
              My jaw drops and my eyes widen as I try to comprehend what my friend just told me, but it does not make any sense. I immediately say, “But I don’t understand why Athena would do that especially if Medusa was raped by Poseidon. Why would she punish the victim?”
              <br>
              “I don’t know. It doesn’t make any sense to me either”, my friend frantically replies, “but some people even think that Medusa deserved it which makes it even worse. They’re all calling her a monster and yet no one is even talking about Poseidon.”
              <br>
              Just as my friend finishes what she is saying, every single person in the hallway turns to look at a girl with bouncy curls confidently walking down the hallway. Each curl was so well defined that it almost looked like a coiling snake. It was quite a statement wig and it would have attracted anyone’s attention, even if she did not have the entire school staring at her. Medusa wore a snakeskin bodysuit that looked like it was made for her body with a black leather miniskirt and knee-high boots. However, it was not even her hair or outfit that made Medusa stand out so much amongst all the other high school students, but her gaze. Medusa’s gaze was so powerful that no one could even dare look her in the eyes.
