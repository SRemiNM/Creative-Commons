            <br>
            It all started one night when I was supposed to walk down the creaky basement steps to grab some batteries. I opened the door, and suddenly this black, ashy fog seeped out from down below. I quickly closed it again, but some of the fog had made it into the room and dissipated into the air. Still, I didn’t think much of it, thinking that maybe I was just seeing things. I called my brother Sam downstairs to go take a look, and he carefully opened the door to the basement. The black fog again came rushing into our living room, and in his shock my brother inhaled some of it. I slammed the door shut as he started coughing. He appeared to be mostly ok, and I decided to call someone to come fix whatever leak was down in that basement.
            <br>
	           The next Wednesday, a guy named Stan showed up to fix whatever sort of problem we had with our basement. For the past few days, I had refused to go anywhere near the basement, even the basement door. The second Stan opened that door, the very same ashy black fog spewed forth from the basement down below. Stan slammed the door shut as quickly as he could and we all breathed a sigh of relief. Not too much of it had escaped the basement, but I noticed that Stan had also started to cough. Looking more closely at Sam, the veins on his hand and arm were very visible, more so than usual. He also had been having coughing fits every so often ever since he inhaled that dark ashy fog. When he finished coughing, Stan determined that he still had to complete his job and fix whatever was causing this fog to spew out from our basement.
             <br>
	            He put on a gas mask and got ready to open the door. Sam and I moved across the room away from the door so we wouldn’t inhale any of that fog. I held my breath in anticipation as he slowly turned the knob. Stan gave a thumbs up before quickly rushing through the door, the door slamming shut behind him. We heard the stairs to the basement creak as Stan went down them, but after that was silence. After five or ten minutes, we still had not heard anything from Stan. I feared the worst and decided to call 911. After a while, some guys in hazmat suits showed up at our house. After listening to our story, they told us to evacuate immediately. I grabbed my things, Sam grabbed his, and we rushed out of the house and into the car.
              <br>
	             I don’t know what happened in our basement, but whatever it was couldn’t have been good. They ended up sealing our house up entirely so that not even air could go in or out. We moved to our parents’ house for the time being, but Sam’s condition only continued to get worse. After a few more days, the veins spread to the rest of his body. He started to become more irritable and cough a lot more too. It started out as small things that came off as him just being grumpy or in a bad mood, like getting into arguments with my parents over small things like what was for dinner, but got worse to the point where he had become just straight up aggressive all the time. That night, he attacked my parents over what tv channel they would watch. His eyes looked animal or even monstrous as he charged them, gleaming in the dark room. He opened his mouth, revealing teeth that had turned into sharp fangs like a snake’s. He sunk his teeth into my mom, and that same ashy fog spewed forth from his fangs. He ran across the room and bit me too, sinking his fangs into my arm.
               <br>
	           For the past week or so I’ve been slowly changing. I feel like I’m losing myself and being taken over by something else, something that seeks to kill. I would try to go to the hospital, but I doubt Sam, or what used to be Sam, will let me out of this house alive. There is nothing I can do left but savor the time I have left, where I can still think and feel and be myself.
