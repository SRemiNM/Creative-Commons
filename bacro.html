            <br>
            A boy as real as they ever come.
            <br>
            <br>
            A boy who can talk and smile and dance.
            <br>
            <br>
            The soul inside of you can burn bright or softly. We are never aware of the inner light we can produce. We can open our mouths as wide as we can, pinch open our eyes, pull our ears; the soul stays inside. It’s locked firmly in its cage. Mad doctors will rip through the skin, the ribs, pry open the lungs, cut the head in two to pursue the soul. It can’t be contained within a bottle or a chest. It will dance and sway and dodge its captor.
            <br>
            <br>
            Yet here is a boy, who did not originate from a mother’s belly. This boy was once a sturdy oak. This boy was felled and carried away from his roots. Perhaps he once had a soul, when he stood mighty among his comrades. Now, he must look up towards the sky as they loom around him, unmoving. He is chopped, grinded, sanded, shipped, sold, and put together again. Now he doesn’t resemble the oak, or a fir, or any arborous shape. He is put together to look like a humanoid. This form could have always existed inside the trunk of the oak, needing to be carved out like a marble sculpture. But the puppet looks nothing like those anatomically perfect beings. His arms are connected with screws. His legs are flat and feet square. His eyes are painted on. He wears clothes to hide his boxy figure. He is everything the statues would sneer at. Malleable, plain, imperfect.
            <br>
            <br>
            But the puppet has life, and the statues do not.
