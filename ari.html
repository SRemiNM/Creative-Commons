            <b>Refraction Pulses</b>
            <br>
            <b>By Ari Krishna</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Ashes to ashes,
            <br>
            Iron to rust,
            <br>
            The blind lead the blind
            <br>
            In God I mistrust.
            <br>
            From grape unto wine
            <br>
            And wine unto dust
            <br>
            A mad star desires
            <br>
            My downfall refined.
            <br>
            <br>
            Like leaves in the wind,
            <br>
            I rise.
            <br>
            <br>
            Could it be that,
            <br>
            Wonder is shape, size, color, sound?
            <br>
            frolicking clouds in summertime skies,
            <br>
            of teddy bears and cats and lines that pop out,
            <br>
            or the spilling of ink, cascading about,
            <br>
            that brings the page to life?
            <br>
            rusted dimes and nickels beneath the old cupboard,
            <br>
            dusted with cobwebs and splinters?
            <br>
            or waterfalls, in ferocious splendor,
            <br>
            that freeze and tower in winter?
            <br>
            oils and dyes that fit all snug,
            <br>
            that weep and shout and pull at strings?
            <br>
            or half-shattered, wind-battered glass bottles,
            <br>
            with beating heart in see-through ribs?
            <br>
            static hums and buzzes of faint nighttime radio
            <br>
            the ebb and flow of familiar conscience?
            <br>
            or the deafening roar of a jet engine,
            <br>
            in stunned tearful silence, as joy departs with love?
            <br>
            I shut my eyes and my world goes dark.
            <br>
            <br>
            Like lead in the sea,
            <br>
            I fall.
            <br>
            <br>
            Should it be that,
            <br>
            awe is fear, rage, repentance, love?
            <br>
            Hands coil tight around your mouth,
            <br>
            lifting you high, helpless to the heavens
            <br>
            thought-shaped terrors morph into unfamiliar demons,
            <br>
            pinned in place, ends staring into abyssal ends at the nightstand
            <br>
            kneel, wretched one, before the pagan altar,
            <br>
            and lift your lusty gaze to the heavens
            <br>
            A wrathful Cain casts down fiery hailstones,
            <br>
            Act not, want not, watch on.
            <br>
            One misstep, sinking into the mire,
            <br>
            You suffocate in dense rainforests of denial,
            <br>
            faintly the flatline of your own monitor plays,
            <br>
            at the gates, a staccato symphony in affliction;
            <br>
            I shut my eyes and my heart goes still.
            <br>
            Selfless, introspective nurturing,
            <br>
            the lunacy of using your scars as a shield,
            <br>
            or finding yourself astonished,
            <br>
            at the absurd things you would do to protect.
            <br>
            I shut my eyes and my world goes still.
            <br>
            <br>
            What are we, but a patchwork quilt of wonder and awe?
            <br>
            hastily sewn, tattered blankets, bloodsoaked fabrics,
            <br>
            smudged with ash and acrid tears and
            <br>
            perhaps a little pixie dust, for the desperate and derealized.
            <br>
            I shut my eyes and my world goes cold.
            <br>
            <br>

            I’m no prey to compromise,
            <br>
            she who in the face falls light,
            <br>
            love’s lost labors crumble and rain
            <br>
            Idly I knit my thread before the fates.
            <br>
            <br>
            I met a girl once in my dreams
            <br>
            She starved and shrilly called to me
            <br>
            When we locked eyes I didn’t see
            <br>
            Though in her veins my fire seethed
            <br>
            <br>
            And breathe I did, through my remorse
            <br>
            <br>
            She flinched and groaned till she was hoarse
            <br>
            In witless farce we did divorce
            <br>
            Phantom pains and searing force.
            <br>
            <br>
            O Lady Death, walk with me,
            <br>
            Shroud me in sweet and saccharine rose petals,
            <br>
            Gild me with delicate frost; adorn me with pearls of morning dew
            <br>
            Entomb me in your clouds of spiral bliss.
            <br>
            Death, darling, I know you don’t give for free,
            <br>
            You always did drive a hard bargain.
            <br>
            Tear into my wailing world, you’ll find that you grasp at thin air,
            <br>
            Glamour sells, but who’s buying?
            <br>
            <br>
            Plasma rises in my lungs,
            <br>
            and with it,
            <br>
            the realization that nothing truly makes sense
            <br>
            I swim in a lethe of sorrows and brine
            <br>
            Disdain will be my undoing
            <br>
            below the pale moon’s radiance.
            <br>
            The inundation begins
            <br>
            of miasma from a hellish sun
            <br>
            Like Ra on his great sunwheel.
            <br>
            <br>
            Bitter brittle chords strain sharp on blunt plaster,
            <br>
            sickening waves of blackest bile,
            <br>
            you tremble,
            <br>
            because the hand that feeds starts to spread its fingers in your chest,
            <br>
            and your rasping growls of protest fall on deaf ears and hollow sockets of eyes,
            <br>
            for in my world of false prophets and soothsayers,
            <br>
            detachment festers and flayed flesh morphs into vast ravens of grief
            <br>
            that fill like sand my every fault
            <br>
            so much so that I can’t hear my own screams,
            <br>
            and my wings are shorn from my aching corpse once more.
            <br>
            <br>
            For I am Mother Kali,
            <br>
            And I will purge this blight from whence it came,
            <br>
            With bowl and sickle I sever these evils at their root.
            <br>
            I stand resolute in the wake of Etna enduring.
            <br>
            <br>
            Insanity, idle insanity,
            <br>
            There is no light in a starless sky,
            <br>
            only fragments beneath its folds.
            <br>
            <br>
            As I lay to rest, lux in tenebris --
            <br>
            My swansong plays in 2/4 time.
