        <h3><u>Editor's Letter</u></h3>
        <i>“No one can stop us from imagining another kind of future, one that departs from the terrible cataclysm of violent conflict, of hateful divisions, poverty, and suffering. Let us begin to imagine the worlds we would like to inhabit, the long lives we will share, and the many futures in our hands.”</i>
        <br>
        <i>-Susan Griffin</i>

        I put that quote there to remind me that there is more to reach, more to imagine, more to visualize, more to hope for. Because sometimes I truly just feel so hopeless. Like there is a constant punch to my stomach and I cannot recover from it. Like my voice doesn’t matter enough. In a world with 7 billion people, how the hell am I supposed to make a space for myself? When someone has the answer to that question, please reach me. But for now, I’d like to think that most things I do have an impact on someone else. That I can walk through my life and have my own sphere of influence. Because you can’t carry the world on your shoulders, you aren’t Atlas. And no matter how much social media guilt tripping there is, you can’t be responsible for everyone and everything. There’s so much despair and hate and torment in this world that we all need a place to dive into, to really zero in and captivate ourselves. I’d like to think that the Creative Commons can do that for someone (maybe I’m biased, but who knows?). Seriously, thank you to everyone who submitted works. I can’t wait to view them all one of these afternoons and think about how talented and cool you guys are. I can’t wait to have explorative conversations with my friends about someone’s writing and how they inspired me. I’m so excited for everyone to see the hard work that our team has put in these past months. Our flower is finally blooming. From fiction writing to some killer instrumentals to inspiring artworks, there’s something that will peak everyone’s interest.

        I want to thank Dominic for trusting me with creative decisions and for giving me the space to figure out how to make the Commons come all together. Thank you to Shastine and Julio for being computer science geniuses and building the website from the ground up. I’m really so grateful for everyone who submitted and everyone who helped (seriously, my heart is full). Thank you to everyone who listened to my constant harassments and my sometimes frantic musings. I hope everyone enjoys reading, viewing, and listening.
        <br>
