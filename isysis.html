            She had naturally platinum blonde hair that flowed down to her back in waves. She was small in stature, but always managed to take up a lot of space. I've always wished I could do that, but I don't know what she had to sacrifice in order to gain this life. She only wore red, black, and white but always with a hint of gold. She attracted kindness and admiration, but I never really saw her be nice, to be honest.  There is another girl that takes up space in a room. Some joke about it being literal, but it's mostly the rich. She didn't have much, but she gave to everyone that needed. She was small and round, with bright but patchy skin that made her look like everyone and no one at the same time. Never had a brand name on her clothing because everything was hand made. People's lives and material wealth reflect how much they sacrificed. So the poorest of the poor are the purest souls. But they never really crossed paths until it was almost forced. In the community once a year they take a person, a girl most of the time, from each class based on their sacrifice and whoever wins gets to be at the top. I was in the competition with them, but I had clear orders from my family about what I could sacrifice. Only animals since it was my family's trade anyway. They became the unlikely pair. I was curious, to say the least, but I just did what I needed to do. I already knew that Emerence would not touch a soul unless it was to help them as they passed. That was actually what she was commonly known for, she was always humble about her ability to pray and comfort those in need. She was an angel. The rich often said why doesn't the “Angel” have anything then?” I say in my head everytime “Well she wouldn't be an angel if she did what you have to gain your wealth.” Sylvan was the complete opposite, or so it seemed. Stuff mostly got handed to her after she smiled. She had a way about her. A type of deception. I watched as they walked in the same direction, but turned my head away, figuring it was nothing. But I had to know.
            <br>
            “But I thought you needed help” She says with tears in her eyes. “Well, looks can be deserving, my dear. Now I lay you down to sleep. I ask your Lord your soul to keep…” Emerence closed her eyes and went limp. Sylvan found her perfect sacrifice. She caught my eye and gave me a smile.
